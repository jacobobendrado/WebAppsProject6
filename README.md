## Installation Instructions

First, clone this repository from GitHub.
  Make sure that `git` is installed and able to be used from the command line.

Then, make sure Node.js is installed and `npm` is set up properly.

Once downloaded, have one terminal in the `/client` directory and run `npm run dev`
  Vite must be installed, which can be done by running `npm i -D vite`

Next, have a second terminal in the `/server` directory and run `npm start`
  Bcrypt might cause problems depending upon the operating system, so try running `npm uninstall bcrypt` then `npm i -D bcrypt`

Once both servers are up, navigate to **http://localhost:5173**
